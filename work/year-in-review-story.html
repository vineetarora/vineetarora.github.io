                            When was the last time you celebrated your success?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            It is said that celebrating small achievements motivates us to work towards greater ones. This winter, I worked with HackerEarth, a company which used this philosophy to provide value to its customers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                           HackerEarth’s aim is to build the largest community of programmers in the world. Its users range from students and competitive programmers to job seekers with one goal: To be a better programmer. By the end of 2016, HackerEarth planned to acknowledge their efforts in this direction.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This December, when I joined HackerEarth as a product design intern, I was assigned the task of designing a ‘year in review’ for HackerEarth users. Honestly speaking, I didn’t even know what a year in review meant (I thought of it as a year-end review). Nevertheless, I googled it out.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Rahul (senior designer at HackerEarth) had proposed this idea and shared a doc that contained the expectations from this project. Reading it, I found that till then, HackerEarth used to send personal e-mails to its users for this purpose.
                        </p>

                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/earlier-email-design.png">
                            <p class="caption">
                                e-mail that HackerEarth sent to its users in 2015
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            These e-mails contained statistics like number of problems solved, number of code submissions etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            But this time was going to be different. We planned to create a personalised web page for every HackerEarth user. I went through every link shared by Rahul and found that every year in review was a marketing-focused web page, which told about how the company had progressed. Our aim was different i.e. to show how our users had progressed. Marketing too was a goal but it was secondary.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            So, I contacted Vishal (backend engineer at HackerEarth) to know what data we could extract about each user.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I narrowed it down to the following parameters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    No. of challenges/hackathon participations
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Improvements in the ratings of each user
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Practice parameters, such as number of problems solved and number of points earned
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Coding parameters like number of code submissions and number of correct submissions
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Number of new followers
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With these parameters in mind, I sketched rough designs for different statistics.
                        </p>    
                    
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/paper-layouts.jpg">
                            <p class="caption">
                                Rough layout of the website in the form of different cards

                        </div>
                    
                        
                    
                        

                        <p>
                           However, I was still not sure about the order in which the content was to be displayed. I took inputs from some of my colleagues and asked them to sort the cards in a logical order. This is how the order was decided.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My idea was to make two versions for each user — a personal version (which addressed the user as the first person e.g. You had a great 2016) and a public or shared version (which referred to the user as a third person e.g. Vineet had a great 2016).
                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            The First Meeting
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Maddy (product manager at HackerEarth) scheduled a meeting with all the team members to discuss my thoughts about the review. While I showed my cards to everyone in the meeting, someone suddenly pointed out.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p class="highlighted-text">
                           What if the data in a certain section was not good enough for a user to share publicly? What if the user did not want to share a particular section.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            The solution seemed simple: Let the user choose what to share and what not to. Thus, everyone started discussing how it could be done. But there was something going wrong here. Sharing, our secondary aim, had taken the center-stage. Our aim was not to generate popularity but make our users happy.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            I didn’t realise this and moved on to build a high-fidelity wireframe for it. I also used InvisionApp to create a prototype to mimic how a user could select what all cards to share publicly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was then when Vivek (Chief Technology Officer of HackerEarth) realised that we were going off-track. Investing so much time on a secondary goal was an overkill. He suggested that we scrap this feature and it was then moved to a lower priority.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            Now, the work seemed lesser. I just had to convert the wireframes to mockups. I tried different themes, scrolled Behance and Dribbble and came up with a few designs.
                        </p>
                    
                    
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/mockups-try-1.png">
                            <p class="caption">
                                
                            </p>
                        </div>


                        <h3>
                            I finally settled on this design
                        </h3>
                    
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/iteration1.gif">
                            <p class="caption">
                                Iteration 1 | Year in review

                        </div>
                    
                        <p>
                            Inevitable as it is, there were suggestions for improvement e.g. imbibing a feeling of celebration and cheerfulness. Although the mockup seemed beautiful, it had to be cheerful too. So, the next task was to make it amusing.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Putting my research hat on, I googled keywords like amuse, cheerful, happy etc., besides going through a number of year-in-reviews shared on yearinreview.co. Hours were spent scrolling on Dribbble and Behance. And finally, I had a clearer picture in mind. There were two aspects I had to introduce in my design:
                            Cheerfulness and Human touch.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I thus worked on a hot air balloon theme. I called it Cloud9 theme (for cloud nine means happy and clouds were to be present in my design too). Iteration 2 was now ready!
                        </p>
                    
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/iteration2.gif">
                            <p class="caption">

                        </div>
                        
                        <p>
                            This time, the team was happy with the design. I was planning to wrap it up and move on to the next project. But this was just the beginning. Thinking that my design would speak for itself all alone was a misconception. I had missed an important step — communicating my design decisions to the team.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Now, it was time to sit with Akanksha (frontend engineer at HackerEarth) to help her understand the design details while she wrote the frontend code. I charted out design specs, uploaded assets into Google drive, shared the animations, and created the tablet and mobile versions of the website.
                        </p>

                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/design-specs.PNG">
                            <p class="caption">
                                Design specifications
                            </p>
                        </div>
                                        
                        <p>
                            Now came the hard part- Explaining the card removal logic to the team. Every card was supposed to appear only when it conveyed a happy message e.g. if your overall rating fell during 2016, the rating card would not appear. But what would the website look like if certain cards were missing? To solve this problem, I printed out the website on A4 sheets and cut the different sections. Then I called for a meeting and placing all the cards on a table, I showed the different possibilities of the website by removing cards one by one from the stack. This solved the problem as everyone understood the concept.
                        </p>

                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../img/work-stories/year-in-review/printed-website.jpg">

                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                           Thereafter, long work hours followed. Everyone in the team worked hard. I marvelled at the patience with which Akanksha incorporated every detail of the design into her code. Vishal completed the backend design with Santosh who also coded the animations using CSS sprites.

                            As the deadline approached, Vivek jumped in to help the team to complete the project on time. He pointed out that the design could have been much better in terms of the development effort required for it. It was also a shortcoming on my part because I had assumed that all my assumptions were clear to the team as my designs were intuitive enough. Unfortunately, they were not.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Nevertheless, we all kept pushing ourselves. In my free time, I designed the publicity content i.e. the email that would direct the users to their respective websites, the facebook cover photo, og-image etc.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            There was an addition in the end. What about those who did not perform well at all? What about the inactive users. Of course, they had to have an explanation on why their year in review did not exist. So, Maddy took charge of the situation and wrote a blog on how people could become better programmers in 2017 from HackerEarth portal. Vivek designed a flow by which users would be directed to this blog if they did not have their year in reviews.

                        <h3>The Launch</h3>

                        <p>
                            Finally, the launch date arrived. Santosh started sending e-mails to the users. As expected, the click rates for these e-mails were quite high (double the HackerEarth average). But the best part was yet to follow. The next day, Vivek’s mailbox was receiving thank you e-mails from the HackerEarth users.

                        <p>
                            Programmers were feeling motivated and were appreciating our efforts. It was finally the time to celebrate. Vivek rolled out a treat for the whole team.

                        <p>
                            Just as we take care of making everything simple for our users, we should also focus on doing the same for our developers too. They are the ones who have to bring the product to life. Ensuring that they have a clear understanding of the details of the design goes a long way in a better collaboration and thus a better product.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A good design balances a good user experience and a minimum development effort. Neither of the two can alone lead to a successful product. In my case, I could have designed a simpler system. Nevertheless, the competitive HackerEarth team did not let the complexity become a roadblock.

                        <p>
                            Most of the design decisions I took, could be taken only because I was backed by Akanksha and Santosh for correcting my errors. They gave me the freedom to take risks. I iterated multiple times. I failed multiple times. But in the end, I had created a successful design.
                        </p>

                            This internship at HackerEarth was more challenging and delightful than any other experience before. Not only did it let me push my limits in what I already knew, it made me go beyond to learn more and adapt to the dynamic year in review project.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            I tried my hands on character animation, learned about CSS sprites (thanks to Santosh), learned the importance of flowcharts in estimating the development efforts on design and above all, learned to work with a real engineering team making a real product for real people.
                        </p>

                    
                        <p>
                            A major feature of this experience was the prevalence of Design culture in the team. Everyone cared about the end user. Having observed many other work cultures during my college, I can say that this culture is hard to maintain. Kudos to HackerEarth for this. This design culture made me feel more confident about taking risks because people were always there to help out if things went wrong.
                        </p>

                    
                        <p>
                            Overall, this internship added beautifully to my personality as a designer, as a teammate, as a friend and as a mentee. I wish every aspiring designer gets a chance to work with a team like HackerEarth.
